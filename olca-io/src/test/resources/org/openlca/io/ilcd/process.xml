      <technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses xml:lang="en">ABS takes its name from the initial letters of the three immediate precursors (acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene) and is a two phase polymer system consisting of a glassy matrix of styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer and the synthetic rubber, styrene-butadiene copolymer. ABS is technically produced by co- or graft copolymerisation of the three base monomers in emulsion or mass polymerisation. By varying the share of monomer input the technical properties of ABS are influenced. The background system is addressed as follows:
Electricity:
Electricity used, is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation. Modelling the electricity production system covers the production and delivery of primary fuels, the steam generator, the electricity generator and the distributor.
Electricity is regarded to be derived from the public electricity supply and from on-site electricity generation of plants. Input materials used for producing electricity are fossil fuels, like coal, oil and gas.
Process Steam:
Process steam/thermal energy used, is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation. Process steam is regarded to be derived as by-product from the public electricity supply and from on-site steam generation of plants. Input materials used for producing process steam are fossil fuels, like coal, oil and gas. Another source for process steam are waste incineration plants.
Transport:
All relevant and known transport processes used, are included. Overseas transport to and from major ports as well as all relevant and known pipeline and / or tanker transport of crude oil imports are included.
Energy carriers: 
Crude oil is modelled according to the production and supply of crude oil to Western Europe. The crude oil supply is regarded regional. Therefore, interchanges between countries within that region do not count as imports or exports. Oil processing is reckoned as standard worldwide with overall energy production efficiency of the order of 90%. The IEA data on world oil production and processing data have been used for the use of energy. The total inputs have been partitioned between the products using energy as the partitioning parameter. Modelling covers the extraction, the transport and the delivery including emissions arising at the extraction site and reported losses during subsequent distribution of the oil. The transport for indigenous crude oil production is based on the characteristics of North Sea production since this represents 98% of indigenous production. For North Sea oil some 75% is delivered by pipeline with the remainder delivered by tanker.
Coal modelling covers the production, the transport and the delivery.</technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses>

      <deviationsFromSelectionAndCombinationPrinciples xml:lang="en">Many industrial sites contain a large number of different plants and therefore it is usual that certain services are provided from some central source. That is the case of the provision of steam and compressed air, and the treatment of water. In this case the attribution of these central services is a matter of estimating and guesswork. Frequently the information is not held by the companies in a form that is directly usable in eco-profile calculations. For example, air and water emission are normally expressed as concentrations (kg/m3) whereas eco-profiles want the total annual loading (kg/year). Companies can often make the conversion using internal conversion factors, but there is no standarisation of these factors across Europe. Besides, issues such as weighing errors, materials in transit, stock changes and so on, make it difficult to maintain absolutely accurate records.</deviationsFromSelectionAndCombinationPrinciples>
      <dataTreatmentAndExtrapolationsPrinciples xml:lang="en">Missing data are substituted by the average value calculated from the data supplied by those plants that made positive returns. Thus, for example, suppose that three plants with the same output volume fill in questionnaires. For one of the parameters, one plant returns a value of 1 mg, the second plant returns a value of 2 mg and the third is unable to provide the data. The average from the two plants returning data is 1.5 mg and this value is substituted in place of the missing data for the third plant.</dataTreatmentAndExtrapolationsPrinciples>
