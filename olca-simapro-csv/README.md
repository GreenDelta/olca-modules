olca-simapro-csv
================
This is a simple API for writing and reading data sets in the SimaPro 
CSV format.

TODO
----
* The first version of that API contained a much more functionality regarding 
  the pedigree matrix but the code may is a bit to complicated (see the archive
  folder). The current implementation handles the pedigree information just as
  a string.
