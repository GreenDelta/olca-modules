# Builds the native part of olca-eigen library for Mac OS X.
# In order to run the build you need to have the following tools installed:
# 
# 	* Java JDK 7.x (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
# 	* the OS X command line tools (normally the installation is 
#     triggered when you type `gcc -v`in the terminal)
#	* gfortran and maybe other tools like wget and perl for the OpenBLAS build
#
# gfortran (and also tools like wget) can be installed easily via homebrew (http://brew.sh)
