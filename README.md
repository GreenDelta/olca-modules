# openLCA â€“ modules
This project provides the core functionality of [openLCA](http://openlca.org) as
a set of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) modules. Since version version 1.4
the [openLCA application](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-app) is built on
top of these components.


## Installation
In order to install the modules, you need to have a [JDK >=17](https://adoptium.net)
and [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed.
[Download](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-modules/archive/master.zip) the
repository (or get it via git), navigate to the root folder and type the
following command in your console:

```bash
cd  olca-modules
mvn install
```

This will build the modules from source and install them into your local Maven
repository. If the build fails because of failing tests you can skip the tests
via:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests=true
```
