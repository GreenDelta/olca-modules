	 * The process or product system is modeled considering the consequences

	 * production of the named product, technology, market and time including

	 * approach also other consequences in the economy's or global production
	 * system are considered. Substitution of co-products is one component often
	 * used in consequential modeling. Details are given in "Deviation from LCI
	 * method principle / explanations". Example: if a new product variant B
	 * requires more electricity in its use phase than the actual product A, it
	 * is assumed, that this additional electricity comes exclusively from
	 * natural gas combined-heat-and-power plants, as these are argued to be the
	 * actual marginal (i.e. additional) technology for electricity production
	 * installed to satisfy additional demand. Note that allocation is
	 * (generally) not appropriate under consequential modeling.
