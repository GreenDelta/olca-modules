                    <xs:documentation>The process or product system is modeled considering the consequences it's production causes, assuming this additional demand results in
                        additional production of the required materials, energy carriers, components etc. Typically the expected/assumed marginal change in the production of the
                        named product, technology, market and time including for the background system. Depending on the specific consequential approach also other consequences in
                        the economy's or global production system are considered. Substitution of co-products is one component often used in consequential modeling. Details are
                        given in "Deviation from LCI method principle / explanations". Example: if a new product variant B requires more electricity in its use phase than the
                        actual product A, it is assumed, that this additional electricity comes exclusively from natural gas combined-heat-and-power plants, as these are argued to
                        be the actual marginal (i.e. additional) technology for electricity production installed to satisfy additional demand. Note that allocation is (generally)
                        not appropriate under consequential modeling.</xs:documentation>
